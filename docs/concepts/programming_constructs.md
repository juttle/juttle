Programming Constructs
======================

Juttle supports several programming constructs that are similar to other programming languages and make it easier to write and compose Juttle flowgraphs.

If you already know JavaScript and UNIX command-line tools, then elements of of Juttle will look familiar to you. Functions, variables, *if* statements, and other elements of the Juttle syntax are similar to their JavaScript equivalents.
At the same time Juttle also borrows elements from UNIX command-line tools, with pipes and options that look like -option arguments to shell programs.

Constants
=========

You can write constants in Juttle and use them in context within the flowgraph. By their nature, constants can't be assigned to or modified after being defined.

Juttle uses lexical scoping, so constants are scoped to the context in which
they're written.

For example:

```juttle
const n = 10;
emit -limit n -from :0: | reduce count() | view table -title "10 points";

const n2 = n * n;
emit -limit n -from :0: | reduce count() |  view table -title "100 points";
```

Functions
=========

A Juttle function performs a calculation based on provided inputs and returns a
single result. Juttle comes with some built-in functions exposed through the built-in [modules](../modules/index.md), and you can also define your own functions.

A function can operate over any number of arguments, and can be invoked
with literals, variables, or field values as the arguments to the function.

For example, the following computes a point count and the square of the point count using the function `Math.pow`:

```juttle
emit -limit 10
| put num_points=count(),
      points_squared=Math.pow(num_points, 2),
      points_cubed=Math.pow(num_points, 3)
```

Users can define their own Juttle functions, using the `function` keyword. The syntax is similar to Javascript functions, although parameters can be given default values.

```
function functionName(parameter1[=default_value1], parameter2[=default_value2]...) {
   code to execute
}
```

Functions can contain variable or constant declarations, assignments,
*if* statements, and *return* statements. Juttle functions can also be
nested by declaring one function inside another function.

For example, the following is a recursive implementation of `Math.pow` with a default exponent of 2:

```juttle
function pow(value, exponent=2) {
    if (exponent == 1) {
        return value;
    } else {
        return value * pow(value, exponent - 1);
    }
}

emit -limit 10
| put points=count(),
      points_2=pow(points), // default exponent = 2
      points_3=pow(points, 3)
```

Reducers
========

Reducers are a Juttle-specific construct that allows operating on field values of data points as they stream through the flowgraph, to carry out a running computation.

Reducers are used in [reduce](../processors/reduce.md) and [put](../processors/put.md) assignment expressions.

Juttle comes with a number of [built-in reducers](../reducers/index.md), including [count()](../reducers/count.md), [sum()](../reducers/sum.md) and [max()](../reducers/max.md) used in this example:

```juttle
emit -from :0: -limit 10
| put value = count()
| reduce sum = sum(value), largest = max(value)
```

Users can define their own reducers using the `reducer` keyword. To understand how reducers function, see [User-defined reducers](../reducers/juttle_reducers_user-defined.md) section that gives an annotated example.

Variables
=========

Variables can be defined inside reducers and functions, but not inside
subgraphs or at the top level of a flowgraph. Since Juttle uses lexical
scoping, variables are scoped to the reducer or function in which
they're defined.

Unlike constants, variables support assignment after they are defined:

For example:

```juttle
const x = 5;
function xplus(y) {
    var z = x;
    z = x + y;
    return z;
}
emit | put value=xplus(10);
```

String Templating
=================

Strings in Juttle support template syntax to enable embedded expressions to be evaluated and converted to a string more conveniently.

The syntax for embedded expressions is `${expression}`, where the referenced expression can be a [constant](#constants), variable, literal, a value from a field in the point, or the result of an expression.

For example, the following juttle builds the same text string using both templating and manual construction of the string values.

```juttle
const N = 10;
emit -limit N
| put text1="point ${count()} of ${N}, elapsed time ${time - :now:}"
| put text2="point " + Number.toString(count())  + " of " + Number.toString(N) +
            ", elapsed time " + Duration.toString(time - :now:);
```

Modules
=======

Juttle modules are a way of reusing code across multiple Juttle programs.

Exporting symbols
-----------------

Any saved juttle program can be used as a module if it exports functions, [constants](#constants), [inputs](./inputs.md), [subgraphs](#subgraphs), or [reducers](../reducers/index.md) by prefixing them with the `export` keyword.

For example:

```
    export const answer = 42;
    export function ask(question) { return answer; }
    export sub elucidate { put a = answer }
    export reducer answerable(q) { /* ... */ }
```

Importing modules
-----------------

Given a juttle program containing exported symbols that is saved at a known
location, then in another program you can import it as a module, using the
`import` keyword:

```
    import "<module_path>" as local_name;
```

How the `<module_path>` is resolved depends on the specific capabilities of the
application in which Juttle is running. For the Juttle CLI, it can be either a
relative or absolute filesystem path or a URL to a remote Juttle file containing
exported code.

Once it is resolved, the import statement pulls all exported symbols from the
specified Juttle module and makes them available under the specified local
namespace.

You can reference the imported symbol(s) like this:

```
    local_name.symbol_name
```

-  local_name is the local name from the import command above.
-  symbol_name is the name of the exported subgraph, constant, function, 
   or other code fragment from the imported program file.

Module Behavior
---------------

When defining or importing modules:

-   An `import` or `export` statement is only valid in the top-level context of a program. This means that an import or export statement cannot be used inside
    [subgraphs](#subgraphs),
    [functions](#functions),
    or
    [reducers](../reducers/index.md).

-   Cyclic module dependencies are forbidden. For example, a compilation error occurs if module1 imports module2 and module2 also imports module1.

-   Top-level flowgraph statements are not exported, instantiated, or executed upon module import.

    In the first example above, `emit | stamper -mark "test"` is not exported.


_Example: export from module_

This juttle module exports a function, a subgraph, and a constant. 

```juttle
export const pi = 3.14;                                // exported constant
const not_exported = 2;                                     // not exported
export function double(x) { return x * not_exported; } // exported function

export sub stamper(mark) {                             // exported subgraph
	put stamp = mark
	| put stamp2 = mark
}

// top-level flowgraph is not exported
emit
| stamper -mark "test"
| view table;
```

_Example: import by filename_

This example assumes that the program with exports is saved at path
`docs/examples/concepts/export_module.juttle`.

```juttle-no-syntax-check
// This program is runnable from CLI from the juttle repo root,
// juttle docs/examples/concepts/import_module.juttle

import 'docs/examples/concepts/export_module.juttle' as my_module;
emit
| my_module.stamper -mark 'test'
```

_Example: import by URL_

This example assumes that the exported module is saved as a
[github gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jut-test/273396ac4efcc838687b/)
containing `main.juttle` file.

```juttle-no-syntax-check
// This program is runnable from CLI from the juttle repo root,
// juttle docs/examples/concepts/import_module_from_url.juttle

import 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jut-test/273396ac4efcc838687b/raw/dde7c96c7560c38a29881d0345fc2d5727ee082e/main.juttle'
  as this_module;
emit
| this_module.stamper -mark "test"
```

Subgraphs
=========

Subgraphs are reusable Juttle fragments that can be invoked within the
current program or exported as modules that other programs can import.

Subgraphs are declared with the `sub` keyword, like this:

```
sub sub_name([arg1,arg2]) {
     juttle code
}
```

A subgraph can take as many arguments as it needs, or none.

_Example: simple sub with no arguments_

```juttle
// declare a subgraph called "my_viz" with no params
sub my_viz() {
  put num_points = count()
  | (view table; view timechart)
};

emit -limit 2
| put message = "Hello World!"
| my_viz; // invoke the subgraph here
```

<img src="../../images/diagrams/juttleOverviewDiagrams/overview5.png" alt="overview5" style="width: 400px;"/>

With this approach, experienced coders can express complex business
logic and rich visualizations, then make them available to other Juttle
authors to reuse.

_Example: sub with optional argument_

Here the default value will be used if the program that invokes the subgraph
does not specify a different value:

```juttle
sub banner(title='Generic title') {
  emit -limit 1 | put value=title | view tile -timeField '';
}
banner -title 'Custom title';
```

See [Field referencing](fields.md#referencing)
for tips on working with the contents of fields from within a subgraph.
